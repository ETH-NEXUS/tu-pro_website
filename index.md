<div class="text-block">
    The Tumor Profiler Study is an observational clinical study combining a prospective diagnostic approach to assess the relevance of in-depth tumor profiling to support clinical decision-making ("Fast Diagnostic loop") with an exploratory approach to improve the biological understanding of disease ("Exploratory science loop").
    <br/><br/>
    For this study of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia tumors, in addition to the emerging standard diagnostic approaches of targeted NGS panel sequencing and digital pathology, extensive characterization is performed using the following exploratory technologies: single-cell genomics and transcriptomics, proteotyping, CyTOF, imaging CyTOF, pharmacoscopy, and 4i drug response profiling (4i DRP).
